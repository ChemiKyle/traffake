With the recent decision by Congress to [get rid of user protection from ISP data selling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/03/29/what-to-expect-now-that-internet-providers-can-collect-and-sell-your-web-browser-history/), I made a program to muddy the waters and make your data less attractive to potential buyers.
